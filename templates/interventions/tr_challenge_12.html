                <p>Transport-related physical activity refers to physical activity that you do for traveling from place to place, including to work, stores, and movie theaters. Walking or bicycling for sustained periods helps adults with obesity to meet physical activity recommendations such as 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week.</p>

                    <h3>Transport-Related Physical Activity: Learning</h3>
                    <p>Transport-related physical activity refers to physical activity that you do for traveling from place to place, including to work, stores, and movie theaters. Walking or bicycling for sustained periods helps adults with obesity to meet physical activity recommendations such as 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. If public transportation is available, it may also improve health because most people walk or bicycle to access public transportation. Increasing transport-related physical activity is useful because many people, including adults with obesity, struggle to find separate time for leisure-related physical activities, such as playing sports.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unfortunately, there are some external barriers to transport-related physical activity. Many lifestyles in the United States are built around car travel, and some cities may provide few opportunities for transport-related physical activity. To increase transport-related physical activity, it is important to reduce car dependency and provide increased opportunities for walking and bicycling. We understand that some do not use active transportation options like walking or bicycling because they think it is unsafe, unavailable, or unreliable.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, many cities provide safe, reliable, and easy access to transport-related physical activity, for example, sidewalks, bike lanes, and public transportation. In some areas, active transportation can replace motor vehicle use entirely. Check the availability of resources and infrastructure in your community, such as accessibility and conditions of sidewalks and bike lanes, to make the decision to walk or bicycle for transportation easier.</p>
                    
                    <p>The good news is that some internal barriers to transport-related physical activity can be addressed. For instance, the perceived additional time to walk or bike rather than drive is a barrier to transport-related physical activity. However, most people overestimate the time required for active travel. You may estimate the time needed to walk or bike by using a web mapping platform (e.g., Google maps) and plan accordingly. Also, fitness and ability in adults with obesity to travel long distances on foot or on a bicycle can also be a concern. In this case, combining walking with driving for longer trips (e.g., half of the trip driving and the rest walking) or using an electric-assist bicycle can make the active trip achievable and enjoyable. Unlike external barriers, internal barriers (e.g., perceived difficulty) to transport-related physical activity can be overcome by you!</p>
                    
                    <p>Some physical activity in transportation is better than none for your health, Still, Transport-related physical activity may not be enough to meet the physical activity recommendation. Therefore, it is important to have other types of physical activity as well, for example, work-, domestic-, and leisure-related physical activity.</p>
